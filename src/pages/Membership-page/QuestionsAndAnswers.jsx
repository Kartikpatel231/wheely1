      answer: "To become a member, you can either apply an invitation received from an existing member or by completing at least 15 journeys within 6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I share my membership privileges?",
      answer: "New members receive three invitations to share with trusted contacts. Every invitation sent to someone who has never experienced Wheely before comes with a complimentary journey. Once each recipient completes their first journey, we will also credit the first member's account with a complimentary journey of their own (up to a total of three journeys)."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I apply a membership invitation?",
      answer: "To redeem your invitation, follow the link shared by your contact or enter the invitation code manually in the membership section of the app (Membership â†’ Become a Member). The invitation can only be applied if you are not an active or expired member."
