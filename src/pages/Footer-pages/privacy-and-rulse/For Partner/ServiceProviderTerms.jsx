  {/* Legal Basis Section */}
  <section className="mb-10">
    <h2 className="text-lg mb-6">3. THE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH WE USE INFORMATION</h2>
    <p className="text-[16px] mb-4">
      We must have a legal basis to process your personal data. In most cases the legal basis will be one of the following:
    </p>
    
    <ul className="mb-6">
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>Contractual obligations: Personal data is processed to facilitate the fulfilment of the contract between the chauffeur and the user or Wheely.</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>Legitimate interest: Personal data may be processed on the ground of legitimate interest in doing so, for example:</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul className="mb-6 ml-10">
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>to investigate and detect fraudulent payments, fraud and other malicious or unlawful activities and/or safety or security incidents;</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>to make recordings and logs: depending on your location, we may record messages and orders given both on our premises and/or using means of communication as well as information and other activities we have performed. If necessary, we use these recordings for investigations, proof and protection against claims, and/or for quality assurance.</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>for technical and cyber security reasons: such as combating piracy and ensuring the security of the service, website, Wheely platform and app as well as for making and storing back-up copies and preventing/repairing technical issues (depending on the issue, all data may be processed); and</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>to issue or defend legal claims.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul className="mb-6">
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>We may also in certain circumstances rely on alternative legal basis when it is more appropriate to do so, such as:</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul className="mb-6 ml-10">
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>when it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation such as for processing data when the law requires it, including, for example, if there is a valid legal request to disclose personal information to a third party such as a court or regulatory authority;</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>when it is necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others, for example in the event of an emergency or a threat to life; and/or</span>
      </li>
      <li className="flex mb-3">
        <span className="mr-7">—</span>
        <span>when you have given us clear consent to do so for another specific purpose of which you have been fully informed.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p className="text-[16px] mb-4">
      In countries where legitimate interest is not an available lawful basis for Wheely's processing activities, we will instead rely on an alternative valid legal basis available as set out above.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-[16px] mb-4">
      Where personal data is processed for a new purpose which is different to the purpose for which the personal data was originally collected and the processing is not based on the data subject's consent, we carefully consider such new processing to determine whether it is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected. We will consider any link between the original purpose and the new purpose, the context in which the data are processed, the nature of the data, the possible consequences of the processing, and any safeguards that can be taken to ensure the data are adequately protected.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-[16px] mb-4">
      To the extent we process any special category data or criminal record data, we shall in addition to relying on one of the lawful bases set out above, rely on the fact that such processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations and/or it is in the substantial public interest to do so.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-[16px]">
      We may obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of personal information when we are required to do so by law. If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this privacy policy.
