            May 2024 — Wheely, the Swiss-founded British luxury services company committed to helping people reclaim their time by connecting them to places and people that matter, partnered with iconic florists in London, Dubai, and Paris to offer an exclusive bouquet and chauffeur-delivered flower service. The specially designed bouquets, named “Garden of Wheely”, were designed in collaboration with each local florist, displaying the season’s finest, most luxurious flowers. A longstanding tradition, Wheely reintroduced its bespoke bouquet service to celebrate two special occasions, International Women’s Day and Mother’s Day.

        <p className='mb-5'>
            A traditional service perfected by modern technology, Wheely makes celebrating a loved one effortless. The bouquet delivery service, available via the Wheely app, saved customers the hassle of finding the perfect florist, choosing the flowers, or worrying about a missed, late, or impersonal delivery when celebrating their loved ones. The service was the ideal opportunity for anyone to trial Wheely Concierge, a members-only service, which gives customers the luxury of time as a chauffeur can help with their errands. From picking up the perfect wine pairing for dinner, and couriering sensitive documents, to hand-delivering a surprise gift. 
            </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
            Wheely’s “Garden of Wheely” bouquets were crafted in collaboration with expert florists from FLOWERBX (London), The Flower Society (Dubai), and Eric Chauvin (Paris). Customers were able to personalise the bouquets, that arrived in a velvety sandstone box, with a handwritten notecard, culminating in a truly special experience for women on these days of celebration.
