            Wheely, the Swiss-founded British luxury services company headquartered in London is delighted to announce its partnership with Ascot Racecourse as the Official Chauffeur of Ascot and Royal Ascot. Guests in all enclosures can enjoy a seamless arrival and departure experience when attending Royal Ascot and events at Ascot Racecourse with Wheely.
            </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
            As part of the partnership, Wheely has created a dedicated Royal Ascot VIP Entrance to elevate the guest experience. Exclusive drop-offs at this special VIP entrance are available from 10:30 to 13:30 on Royal Ascot race days.  Pick-ups, along with all drop-offs outside these hours, will be at nearby Car Park 1.

With its commitment of blending modern engineering with traditional notions of luxury service to protect clients’ time, Wheely sets the industry’s highest standards for service, safety, etiquette, and discretion, all via a refined app that supports both pre-scheduled and on-demand bookings.  Clients can experience fixed-rate journeys between Ascot and London across Wheely’s distinguished fare classes, ranging from Business, First Class, XL Class, and member-only New First Class, at their choice.  Wheely Members may also reserve their chauffeur for up to the entire day (Chauffeur For a Day) — to watch over their belongings, collect friends and family to join them for fine dining at Ascot, and return all passengers home in perfect comfort.

           Anton Chirkunov, Founder and CEO of Wheely, said: “We are thrilled to collaborate with Ascot Racecourse and begin our partnership at the prestigious Royal Meeting in 2024. Whether booking New First Class or Chauffeur For A Day, Wheely clients can attend one of the year’s most anticipated events in unparalleled style and comfort.”

            Chloӫ Hamlett, Head of Partnerships of Ascot Racecourse, added: “We are delighted to welcome Wheely to our partnership portfolio, particularly as the first brand to ever work with Ascot in the capacity as Official Chauffeur. Ascot is renowned for providing guests with world-class hospitality when they’re at the racecourse and we’re excited that this experience can now start from the moment guests begin their travel to us.”
